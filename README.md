An online store to buy dress of various elegant styles


ONLINE CLOTHING STORE

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE APPLICATION
The purpose of developing this application is to provide every user the opportunity to browse through the store, review dresses, and make order seamlessly: 
-	See various dresses of different categories.
-	To see more details about the dress.
-	Make purchase
NOTE: This is the MVP version of the application. For the main/full version of the application, I would like to:
-	Implement AI: I want the user to be able to upload a portrait of themselves so that the platform would be able to show them how the dress would look like on them (It could also provide an animation that show the image turning so that users can be able to see the front and back of the dress). This is called Virtual Try-on System
-	Admin Dashboard: Provide a dashboard for the admin.

ACHITECTURE/STRUCTURE OF THE APP
1.	A component/page that shows all the dress in the store. 
2.	A filtering system/component. The product (dress) page should be a single page that uses a filtering system to get dresses of a category, price, etc.
3.	A component/page that shows the full details of a product.
4.	A review component. This shows people reactions, ratings, and comment for a particular dress.
5.	A cart system/component. This takes each user orders
6.	A payment system/checkout system
